I had good knowledge of Marketing foundations from my undergrad. Surprisingly, I found the finance module with Enda Murphy most enjoyable. He was a fantastic lecturer; became familiar with us on first name basis and really engaged and conversed with us. I surprised myself with what I achieved in that module. Hats off to the great lecturer! I learned what type of person I am when it comes to group work. My advice is learn who you are by assessing what you contribute and how you contribute during group projects. Some are leaders, others are thinkers, others are more analytical.

In addition, some classes are delivered as on demand content which means you may have videos and learning materials to engage with alongside your timetable.

Awarding Body and NFQ Level At present the Master of Science in Applied Psychology is not professionally accredited because there are no regulations regarding PSI accreditation for postgraduate Applied Psychology programmes. However, should such regulations be introduced, it is intended that the Master of Science in Applied Psychology will meet the criteria set by the Professional Body. Currently, graduate membership of the PSI is conferred on the basis of the students undergraduate qualification.

The programme contains an embedded exit award, the Postgraduate Diploma in Science in Applied Psychology (60 ECTS, NFQ Level 9) which is available for those who cannot complete the research component of this programme for personal or professional reasons. This is a multimodal programme. Learners are therefore timetabled to be in class or online.

Entrepreneurs can change the way we live and work. If successful, their innovations may improve our standard of living, create wealth and jobs as well as the conditions for a prosperous society. Many of us hear the word entrepreneur and think of the brave individual who forgoes a career in an established organization to pursue a new and potentially risky venture. But entrepreneurship can also be thought of more broadly as a distinctive style of business leadership. Indeed, we can think of a definition of entrepreneurial leadership, with its focus on creating and seizing opportunity, as a foundation for understanding how to build, organize and lead successful, innovative businesses of any age or size. The DBS Diploma in Entrepreneurship is suitable for everyone who wants to learn the skills required to succeed in this field. Students will gain an understanding of decision-making under uncertainty, the variations in strategy among individuals when there is no right or wrong path, and then some guidance about the sorts of trade-offs various decisions and strategies engender. The course is taught in recorded weekly scheduled classes, using a cloud based app that works on any device. In addition students will have access to the Moodle learning management system that brings the class and teacher together for activities and access to resources. In this course we introduce these multiple learning objectives in a powerful way, giving students all the different skills required to become a successful entrepreneur. Startups where entrepreneurs work are different from larger firms, and often encounter unstructured and difficult problems that are not as well-defined as the strategy issues faced by established organizations. Great entrepreneurs can be gregarious or low-key, analytical or intuitive, charismatic or boring, good with details or terrible, delegators or control freaks. What they all need is a capacity to execute projects in certain key ways. It is important to note that evidence shows that entrepreneurial activities and the entrepreneurial mind-set can be learned. Programme Aims and Objectives Students who complete our DBS Diploma in Entrepreneurship should be able to: Understand the process entrepreneurs use to generate ideas for new businesses and shape them into opportunities supported by a business model Recognise and learn the core competencies required to become and effective entrepreneurial leader Design a business plan and pitching opportunities Evaluate the importance of effective management of the project life cycle Be able to understand and evaluate how to finance an entrepreneurial venture Attract, recruit, motivate and retain talent as well as building an ecosystem in an entrepreneurial context Develop a marketing and selling plan specifically for the entrepreneurial venture Assessment To meet the requirements of the DBS Online Diploma in Entrepreneurship, a student will be required to complete an individual assignment and an online group project.

The programme will also provide students with an opportunity of connecting the learning points of the programme with their own experience and work environment. For some students, this programme is also a gateway to further entrepreneurship studies. Student Profile Having an idea is just the first step in an entrepreneurial journey. Turning that idea into a compelling opportunity requires analytical capabilities, passion, and determination. Successful entrepreneurs know how to take their ideas and shape them into opportunities to create value for all stakeholders. Entrepreneurship is not for everyone. While it can yield professional achievement, independence and financial success, it can also take time, energy and sacrifice. You do not need to have owned a company before following this path successfully, but there are certain skills and attributes that may be helpful in order to succeed. - Independence - Responsibility - Wiliness to Learn - Persistence - Communication - Convincing attitude and confidence Fees The fee for this online diploma is 1,500.

Student Testimonial I chose DBS over other institutions because a colleague of mind highly recommended DBS. for me one of the main benefits is how easy it is to access staff and material. I chose the Advanced Diploma in Project Management to help progress my current role. I really enjoyed the course and would have no problem recommending it. I wasnt sure if I could get through a diploma course as its over 15 years since I last studied but by completing this course it has showed me I can progress myself academically. I am currently the only one in my team that has done a course like this and already some of my colleagues are looking for information on the course I done. I have the work experience but hadnt the qualification, but now that I have both I can progress further with my career. It was great because my course was relevant to my current role so they overlapped well. The Project Procurement management section helped me prepare a tender in work for project we were currently contracted to deliver. It showed my employer that Im willing to work hard academically to better myself which will improve my work capability. within 3 months of completing the course my salary increased by 5k I can take on more responsibility now.

In it, Freud proposed that the most complicated achievements of thought are possible without the assistance of consciousness. This psychoanalytic position revolutionised our understanding of mental life and the basis of any psychological intervention. Psychoanalysis is a clinical practice which attends to the hidden, or unconscious, processes of the mind. Its epoch-marking insights shed invaluable light on the fragility of meaning in our lives and on the dynamics of mental health and its collapse in illness. Psychoanalysis stands at the origin of all the major developments in psychotherapy over the past 100 years. The MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy at DBS is designed to introduce students in a thorough and rigorous way to clinical settings and practice and so is a solid basis for work in the field of mental health as well as being a foundation for training in the field of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. This course offers a postgraduate qualification which meets the current minimum 4-year postgraduate training requirement to enable graduates to apply with confidence for accredited membership of a professional body in the field. Key Features of the MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy Aims to direct learners in establishing and maintaining a psychoanalytically informed therapeutic position for the practice of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Aims to provide extensive placement experience each 15 weeks, one-day-a week in psychiatric, educational, and social care settings to allow learners to develop a psychotherapeutic position under supervision. Designed paying due attention to requirements of psychoanalytic psychotherapy professional bodies and to discussions regarding statutory and European regulation in the field of psychotherapy. Offers an opportunity to engage with professionals in fields related to psychoanalysis and psychotherapy through attendance at a weekly Psychiatric Case Conference with a multidisciplinary team in St Vincents University Hospital. Classes are typically conducted on Thursday afternoon, followed by two small group tutorials on Thursday night. The three pillars of the programme are personal psychoanalysispsychoanalytic psychotherapy, academic study, and clinical experience with clinical supervision. The psychoanalytic orientation is Freudian-Lacanian. The programme is entirely staffed by practitioner-teachers. Delivery All learners are expected to attend in person in class. Entry Requirements To be considered for admission to the MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, applicants must : Hold a minimum second-class honour (2.2) in an undergraduate degree or relevant prior learning in the field.

Garda Vetting The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016 make it mandatory for people working unsupervised with children or vulnerable adults to be vetted by the Garda Siochana National Vetting Bureau. Under the Acts, anyone whose work or activity involves unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults must be vetted. Workers include staff, volunteers and those on student placements working for a relevant organisation where they have access to children andor vulnerable adults. DBS offers a number of educational Programmes that require students to undertake placements with external agencies, which will bring them into contact with the public and in which they will assume positions of trust. It is for this reason that students on these type of programmes are required to undergo vetting prior to commencing placements (or visits). New entrants on to these programmes will receive the relevant form and information in their orientation packs and will need to complete the process before their final registration on the course can be completed. At the time of application, students will be required to declare as to any previous convictions. Students can start on the course before their Garda clearance is completed but may be withdrawn if the vetting does not produce a satisfactory finding. Where a vetting process identifies a previous conviction the case will be referred to an internal College Vetting Committee. This committee will consider all relevant information in relation to a disclosure from the vetting process and make a determination on the case on behalf of the College. If a student has started on the course and is withdrawn because of a conviction that was not declared at the time of application, any fees paid will not be refunded. DBS will charge a fee of 25 to each student for the administration and costs of obtaining Garda clearance. This fee is payable at the commencement of the programme and is non refundable. CORU Recognition CORU is Irelands multi-profession health regulator whose role is to protect the public through regulating the health and social care professions listed in the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (as amended).

It is the study of human behaviour in all its forms normal and abnormal, natural and learned, productive and destructive. It is a modern and progressive area of study, which with a 150-year history, is currently experiencing unprecedented growth and development in Ireland and internationally. Professional psychologists work in almost every sphere of contemporary life. Psychology contributes to the design of our classrooms and what takes place in them. Psychology teaches employers the best ways to select and motivate employees. Psychology provides crucial insight into the background of social problems such as suicide, addiction and child abuse. They help coaches to train athletes, help the police to investigate crime, help managers to reduce stress in the workplace and help the health services to design effective health promotion campaigns (for example, anti-smoking and safe driving campaigns). Aims and Objectives The general programme aims are as follows: To provide learners with the opportunity to develop, deepen and expand their theoretical knowledge of Psychology. To equip learners with the knowledge, skills and competence required to progress in specialist and applied areas of Psychology. To facilitate in learners a critical knowledge of the main domains of the empirical study of Psychology. To develop in learners a critical awareness of the contribution of Psychology to understanding human behaviour and experience. To allow learners to engage in advanced theoretical debates relevant to the understanding of contemporary issues in society. To give learners an opportunity to access specific and sufficient areas of study to permit them to access relevant further professional recognition.

Student Testimonial I always wanted to study psychology so took the plunge finally. The application process was very easy, the staff were very helpful and intimate classes allow for more tutor attention. I absolutely adored it...I enjoyed the tutors small classes; it made me fall in love with psychology. My favourite subject was Developmental Psychology. I would recommend DBS to other students; its very accessible and the staff are always on hand to help - very quick email replies to any queries. I have recently been promoted...I believe my skills developed me into a better manager hence why I got the job promotion. My future plans are likely to work with the Gaurds and in the prisons with criminology forensic psychology.

This programme aims to accommodate a wide audience of learners from a broad spectrum of industries whose specific learning requirements lie in the area of supply chain management (either business, or technically focused). The DBS Master of Science in Supply Chain Management programme aims to produce individuals with the specialised skills and attributes necessary to meet the demands of the modern-day supply chain management environment. Learners will understand the core principles of supply chain management, as well as procurement and inventory management at leadership level; they will be equipped with operations management and analytics expertise; possess an integrated understanding of global logistics; critically evaluate sustainable supply chains and inform business decision making in an ethical context. They will acquire the knowledge, theory and skills of supply chain management in addition to an industry specialism of interest drawing from modules in the fields of Marketing, Human Resource Management, Information Systems, Project Management, Finance, or Cloud Computing. Moreover, they will develop advanced critical thinking, writing and research skills through the completion of the Research Methods modules along with the completion of a Capstone Module (choice of Dissertation, Applied Research Project, or Placement). The specific programme objectives are as follows: Imbue a critical analysis of the current and emerging theories of supply chain management, informed by up-to-date research and activity in the supply chain management field. Accrue a critical, strategic, and global perspective (incorporating multiple viewpoints) for the supply chain management field. Develop practical skills in procurement and inventory management in supply chain logistics and operations including problem-identification and solving. Develop an in-depth appreciation of supply chain analytics in the form of modern data-driven metrics to business operations and how these can be generated and used. Develop in learners the competencies to be a successful leader in the supply chain environment. Create critical awareness of sustainability and ethical processes that are directly complementary and relevant to the contemporary workplace and future of work. Identify and develop autonomous learning skills for the graduates of tomorrow who can work both independently and collaboratively. Provide the learner with a comprehensive platform for career development, innovation, and further study. Delivery This is a multimodal programme. Learners are therefore timetabled to be in class or online. They will also have mandatory on demand content as contact hours that they can do in their own time and place. Minimum Entry Requirements This programme is aimed at learners with a Level 8 honours bachelors primary undergraduate degree, or Higher Diploma, in a cognate area (e.g. computer science, IT, science, mathematics, statistics, finance, economics, business (including quantitative methods), engineering, maths and management information systems), who wish to specialise in the field of supply chain management with a view to entering the industry, or those with a Level 8 honours bachelors primary undergraduate degree, or Higher Diploma, in a non-cognate area plus three to five years experience of logistics or supply chain management and who require a qualification in this area in order to progress professionally. These will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Learners will need to have achieved a minimum second class second division award (2.2 classification) in their honours Bachelors Level 8 degree. Teaching and Assessment The programme will be structured in a blended format consisting of synchronous online and on-demand delivery. The blended online delivery allows for the most appropriate mode of delivery to be applied to different parts of the syllabus. Typically, the more theoretical content would be delivered through the on-demand mode, with the discursive aspects of the syllabus more inclined to be delivered in the synchronous online mode. Although, such discursive topics can also be considered in an in-class setting. The more practical and assessment-driven parts of the syllabus can also be reserved for the in-class time. Instruction on using the tools and technologies for data analytics can be delivered in class. Formative assessment exercises can be set in any mode to allow the learners to assess progress. Peer review of these formative assessments can help drive this development, which can take place through asynchronous discussion boards or in-class or online discussions. The blended approach will also avail of directed e-learning objects, such as annotated case studies, videos and reading.

The skills developed help lay the foundations and context for the advanced skills developed later in the programme. Core level skills and practical application of supply chain theories, tools and technologies are instilled through the stage one modules, which include Global Supply Chain and ogistics Management, Supply Chain Procurement Strategies, Global Finance for Supply Chain Management, and Supply Chain Operations. Semester two (FT) builds on this by covering advanced modules in which the knowledge, understanding and skills acquired in the first semester can be employed in a more analytical manner. Semester two modules offer Negotiation for Successful Supply Chain Leadership, Analytics and Enterprise Systems for Supply Chain Management, Supply Chain Sustainability, and Conducting Research for Supply Chain Management. Learners will then complete an elective capstone (30 ECTS) of either a Consulting Report for Supply Chain Management, Dissertation or Placement. Depending on the elective option chosen, this will include a robust piece of industry research underpinned by academic theory, primary and secondary data collection and applied in a coherent and industry-focused research report and artefact or traditional dissertation. The Consulting Report for Supply Chain Management, Dissertation or Placement will bring together and synthesise learning from other modules, combining research and technical skills to investigate, design, produce and critically evaluate an area of research interest. The Master of Science in Supply Chain Management is a 1 year full-timetwo-year part-time programme consisting of eight taught modules, four 10 ECTS modules, four 5 ECTS, and a 30 ECTS Capstone (Dissertation, Consulting Report for Supply Chain Management, or a Placement). This programme is offered as a part-time delivery with a recommended learning path that allows completion within a minimum two-year period. It is similar to the full-time programme and is divided into four stages rather than three. In stage one of the part-time delivery, students will follow similar aims to the full-time programme. In stage one they will complete the modules Global Supply and Logistics Management, Supply Chain Procurement Strategies and Global Finance for Supply Chain Management. In stage two of the programme, students will study Supply Chain Operations, Negotiation for Successful Supply Chain Leadership and Analytics and Enterprise Systems for Supply Chain Management. Stage three of the part-time delivery has just two modules: Supply Chain Sustainability and Conducting Research for Supply Chain Management. Finally in stage four of the programme students will complete either their Dissertation, Supply Chain Management Consulting Report or Placement. This is a multimodal programme. Learners are therefore timetabled to be in class or online. They will also have mandatory on demand content as contact hours that they can do in their own time and place.

The orientation of the course is integrativehumanistic with a psychodynamic perspective. Students only being supervised client work following the completion of all modules and requirements at Level 1 and 2 of the programme and a decision regarding suitability to practice. Delivery All learners are expected to attend in person in class. Entry Requirements The minimum entry requirements for the BA (Hons) in Counselling Psychotherapy are: Applications are welcome from those with Leaving Certificate or Level 5 FETAC full award and those with or without a primary degree. However, those under the age of 23 may not have the necessary life experience to satisfactorily participate in this programme, so it is likely to suit mature students. For applicants whose first language is not English and who have not previously undertaken a degree taught through English, evidence must be provided of proficiency in English language equivalent to B2 or above on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL). This must be evidenced through a recognised English Language test such as IELTS, Cambridge Certificate, PTE or DBS English Assessment. Test certificates should be dated within the last two years to be considered valid. It is a requirement that all applicants are interviewed to assess professional suitability. Garda Vetting The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016 make it mandatory for people working unsupervised with children or vulnerable adults to be vetted by the Garda Siochana National Vetting Bureau. Under the Acts, anyone whose work or activity involves unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults must be vetted. Workers include staff, volunteers and those on student placements working for a relevant organisation where they have access to children andor vulnerable adults. DBS offers a number of educational Programmes that require students to undertake placements with external agencies, which will bring them into contact with the public and in which they will assume positions of trust. It is for this reason that students on these type of programmes are required to undergo vetting prior to commencing placements (or visits). New entrants on to these programmes will receive the relevant form and information in their orientation packs and will need to complete the process before their final registration on the course can be completed. At the time of application, students will be required to declare as to any previous convictions. Students can start on the course before their Garda clearance is completed but may be withdrawn if the vetting does not produce a satisfactory finding. Where a vetting process identifies a previous conviction the case will be referred to an internal College Vetting Committee. This committee will consider all relevant information in relation to a disclosure from the vetting process and make a determination on the case on behalf of the College. If a student has started on the course and is withdrawn because of a conviction that was not declared at the time of application, any fees paid will not be refunded. DBS will charge a fee of 25 to each student for the administration and costs of obtaining Garda clearance. This fee is payable at the commencement of the programme and is non refundable. Student Testimonial I chose DBS because it has a good reputation for the counselling and psychotherapy course and for the location. The lecturers and supervisors were fantastic - engaging, knowledgeable and open to questions. The staff did a fantastic job of overcoming the challenges presented by COVID19, the online classes worked really well. By completing this course, it provided me with a new option in my career path. My studies allowed me to practice as a therapist outside of work. The course improved my overall confidence and way of being, its fantastic.

According to the Irish Times (April 2023), there were over 1,000 jobs available in digital marketing in Ireland. This is a growth of over 100 since 2013. Recent restructuring by the tech sector in Ireland has resulted in a wave of job losses in 2023 so far, as some of the biggest global players have announced plans to reduce their headcount and restructure their operations. However, Ireland still has a robust job market and digital skills are in demand, despite the job losses. Digital marketing was one of the top 15 most in-demand skills worldwide in 2021, according to a recent LinkedIn report. Digital marketing specialist positions were among the top 10 fastest-growing job titles, according to the same report. The ongoing roll-out of targeted upskilling and reskilling courses via Momentum and Springboard, including those relating to the ICT Action Plan reflects the need to help people learn new enterprise-relevant skills and to progress to sustainable employment. In a recent report, The Digital Marketing Institute pointed to the transferable nature of the skill set required in marketing, as most businesses now need an online presence and an integrated marketing approach. In DMIs recent whitepaper Perpetual Evolution - the Interplay of talent and Technology in the future of Marketing, they analysed the future skills required in the marketplace over the next five years. Based on a survey of more than 500 marketing executives around the world, Perpetual Evolution demonstrates that while marketers understand the line between traditional and digital marketing no longer exists, 74 believe that marketing organizations face a critical talent shortage due to a lack of digital skills that will be needed to meet ongoing customer demands. This talent gap includes digital experiences, marketing experiences as well as soft skills. The top hard and essential soft skills for marketers are technology, creativity, analytical thinking, marketing, and openness to change. However, the same report contends that companies also want solid and applicable marketing skills such as paid search, social media, analytics, website optimization and content marketing. The acceleration in online browsing and purchasing has shown that the skills in an organisation need to match audience behaviour and needs. It is these skills alongside the future skills named above that are difficult to find. This makes for fierce competition in companies of all sizes for skilled marketers with digital skills. The Certificate in Digital Marketing responds to a known and often articulated skills shortage that exists in this area. The Irish Government and Industry recognise that there is an urgent requirement to ensure an adequate supply of ICT and related talent and skills from both the domestic and international markets to meet the needs. Aims Objectives The objectives of the Certificate in Digital Marketing programme are: Develop knowledge of digital marketing tools and technologies in the context of the business, its products, services, customers and the wider market.

Accreditation The Higher Diploma is aimed at non-counselling andor psychotherapy graduates. It is an academic qualification, and incorporates professional psychotherapy skills training and personal development and will set its graduates on the path towards becoming accredited members of professional counselling and psychotherapy bodies. The Higher Diploma, in combination with our Masters in Psychotherapy, is recognised as a 4 year training by IAHIP (Irish Association for Humanistic Integrative Psychotherapy). The course also prepares students to follow a variety of other educational and career paths by helping them to achieve their full critical potential and equipping them with a range of intellectual skills. Garda Vetting The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016 make it mandatory for people working unsupervised with children or vulnerable adults to be vetted by the Garda Siochana National Vetting Bureau. Under the Acts, anyone whose work or activity involves unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults must be vetted. Workers include staff, volunteers and those on student placements working for a relevant organisation where they have access to children andor vulnerable adults. DBS offers a number of educational Programmes that require students to undertake placements with external agencies, which will bring them into contact with the public and in which they will assume positions of trust. It is for this reason that students on these type of programmes are required to undergo vetting prior to commencing placements (or visits). New entrants on to these programmes will receive the relevant form and information in their orientation packs and will need to complete the process before their final registration on the course can be completed. At the time of application, students will be required to declare as to any previous convictions. Students can start on the course before their Garda clearance is completed but may be withdrawn if the vetting does not produce a satisfactory finding. Where a vetting process identifies a previous conviction the case will be referred to an internal College Vetting Committee. This committee will consider all relevant information in relation to a disclosure from the vetting process and make a determination on the case on behalf of the College. If a student has started on the course and is withdrawn because of a conviction that was not declared at the time of application, any fees paid will not be refunded. DBS will charge a fee of 25 to each student for the administration and costs of obtaining Garda clearance. This fee is payable at the commencement of the programme and is non refundable. Course Content The Higher Diploma in Counselling Psychotherapy programme has the following content. Core Modules Counselling and Psychotherapy Skills 1 Stress Response 1 Process Group Traditions of Psychotherapy Theories of Development Psychoanalysis Group Psychotherapy Counselling and Psychotherapy Skills 2 Stress Response 2 Psychopathology and Case Histories Research Methods and Minor Dissertation The Family and Psychotherapy Assessment Methods The Postgraduate Higher Diploma in Arts in Counselling and Psychotherapy combines experiential learning, academic lecturing and personal development. The Theory and Practice modules in each year of the programme as well as the Stress Response modules consist of experiential learning taking place in training groups with no more than 15 students. The other modules on the programme are delivered in lecture format. Assessment is approached creatively with a range of assessment strategies including essay writing, in-class presentation, group discussion, self-reflective writing and examination. Instructions and guidelines for all assessment are clearly communicated to students. There is no assessment related to personal psychotherapy and process group work. These components of the programme are mandatory and entirely confidential. The cost of personal psychotherapy is not included in the programme fee. Awarding Body and NFQ Level The programme is also currently recognised by the Irish Association of Humanistic and Integrative Psychotherapy (IAHIP) as part of an overall 4 year training programme in conjunction with the MA in Psychotherapy, to allow learners to meet the accreditation criteria in IAHIP Bye-law 11. As part of our ongoing obligation to quality assurance for QQI and IAHIP, DBS will carry out reviews and submit the programme for re-approval as required. This means that there may be changes to programme content or delivery during your programme of study. If this does occur, DBS will carefully consider all transition arrangements to ensure consistency for learners. CORU Recognition CORU is Irelands multi-profession health regulator whose role is to protect the public through regulating the health and social care professions listed in the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (as amended). It includes the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the Registration Boards established under the Act 2005 (as amended). CORU confirmed the establishment of and appointment of members to the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board in 2019, under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (amended) to separately regulate the professions of Counsellors and Psychotherapists. Currently there is no date for the opening of the CORU registers for Counsellors and Psychotherapists. Please refer to the CORU website for more information. DBS will make an application for programme approval to the Registration Board when CORU opens the process. Structure The Higher Diploma in Counselling and Psychotherapy is run on a modular basis during evenings and weekends and will normally take students two years to complete. During that time students will take academic lectures as well as experiential training groups. Research methodologies and the range of contemporary issues that face professional Counsellors and Psychotherapists will also be amongst the topics studied. Students attend and participate in process group work on one evening a week throughout each year, as well as attending academic lectures onetwo evenings a week for two 12 week terms and approximately 12 Saturdays over the academic year. Each year students participate in two feedback meetings with their trainers to assess not only their skills and academic knowledge but also their suitability for progression on to supervised clinical training at MA level. Students are required to be in their own personal psychotherapy for the duration of the Higher Diploma. This confidential arrangement, including the time of sessions and fee, is arranged with the therapist. All learners are expected to attend in person in class. Career Opportunities The Higher Diploma in Counselling Psychotherapy is not in itself full professional training but should enhance employment prospects in the following areas: The Voluntary Sector Primary Care settings Social Care settings Educational settings It is envisaged that the course will appeal to those interested in bridging their undergraduate qualification with further postgraduate study, such as our MA in Psychotherapy. Please note that professional suitability assessment forms part of a pre-enrolment interview, and also continues throughout this programme. A combination of the Higher Diploma in Arts in Counselling and Psychotherapy and the MA in Psychotherapy at DBS should fulfil current requirements of a four-year training that is expected by the professional bodies in the field of psychotherapy.

Programmes are awarded by Quality Qualifications Ireland (QQI) . DBS is currently accepting applications for courses commencing in January and April 2026. See all International Programmes Education in Ireland is managed by Enterprise Ireland, the government organisation responsible for the development and growth of Irish enterprises in world markets. Education in Irelands goals and objectives include: To promote Ireland as a quality destination for students., To promote and support the international activities of Irish education institutions. To act as a national point of contact and referral to and from Irish suppliers of education services and the international market place. To promote Irish education expertise as a valuable resource for international institutions, development agencies and governments. To liaise with education interests and government to identify and remove barriers to the development of the international education sector. QQI the National Framework of Qualifications DBS Degree, Postgraduate Higher Diploma and Masters programmes are accredited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). QQI was established on 6 November 2012 under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012. The new Authority was created by an amalgamation of four bodies that have both awarding and quality assurance responsibilities: the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC), the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) and the Irish Universities Quality Board (IUQB). The new Authority has assumed all the functions of the four legacy bodies while also having responsibility for new or newly-statutory responsibilities in particular areas. Ten Level System The National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) is a ten-level system (110) giving an academic or vocational value to qualifications obtained in Ireland. NFQ levels help indicate how an award can be used for training, education and employment opportunities (see fan diagram). Each level is based on nationally agreed standards of what a learner is expected to know and be able to do after receiving an award. QQI is Irelands guardian of the NFQ system. They are responsible for the quality assurance of providers of education and training. They also have responsibility for the validation of qualifications and also make some awards themselves. NFQ serves several purposes: - It ensures awards obtained in Ireland are quality-assured and recognised internationally - It is part of a system for comparing Irish and international awards - It supports lifelong learning by recognising knowledge and skills within a comparative framework even if they are not recognised by a formal award - It provides a system of establishing eligibility in learning processes for access, transfer and progression - It recognises awards made by professional bodies NFQ is linked to similar frameworks in Europe. This helps people considering employment or study opportunities outside Ireland. There are two qualifications frameworks at European level: 1. The Framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area also known as the Bologna Framework. This deals with higher education awards (NFQ 6-10) 2. The European Qualifications Framework (EQF), which deals with all NFQ levels including schools, Further Education and Training, and Higher Education ABOUT DBS Menu Academic School Staff DBS eSource DBS Staff International Students Terms and Conditions Protection of Enrolled Learners Privacy Policy Website User Agreement Health Safety Statement Cookie Policy Manage Cookie Preferences Company Registration Details COURSES BY SUBJECT Accounting and Finance Arts Business and Management Counselling and Psychotherapy Information Technology Law Marketing and Event Management Media and Journalism Professional Accountancy Psychology and Social Science COURSES BY TYPE Evening Degrees Full-time Degrees Certificates Postgraduate Courses Professional Accountancy Professional Diploma Courses Springboard STUDENT RESOURCES DBS Library Student Services Careers Registrars office Exam office Digitary Core DUBLIN BUSINESS SCHOOL 1314 Aungier Street, Dublin 2, D02 WC04, Ireland.

Student Testimonial I choose the MBA in Cloud Computing because it gave me the opportunity to be in the technical field as well as gain knowledge of Management. Lecturers in DBS are very professional and knowledgable. You can ask them any question and you will get the answer. Attending lectures impacted my education by growing in a new way. My favorite module was of my core program, i.e. Cloud Computing as it taught hands-on experience on AWS as well as theoretical. I was part of a Comp-Soc team in DBS. It was a good and new experience as I got to know new people and new talents. My advice - get enrolled in societies, it will boost your knowledge and give exposure to people from many different countries. I would definitely recommend DBS - it has given me the time which is unforgettable in terms of study, fun, environment, small festival celebrations, pajama nights etc. Its a combination of FUN and Studies.

I had good knowledge of Marketing foundations from my undergrad. Surprisingly, I found the finance module with Enda Murphy most enjoyable. He was a fantastic lecturer; became familiar with us on first name basis and really engaged and conversed with us. I surprised myself with what I achieved in that module. Hats off to the great lecturer! I learned what type of person I am when it comes to group work. My advice is learn who you are by assessing what you contribute and how you contribute during group projects. Some are leaders, others are thinkers, others are more analytical.

This is an arrangement that Higher Education Colleges are required to have by legislation in Section 65 (4) of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012. It is called Protection of Enrolled Learners, or PEL. For all DBS courses covered by the legislation, DBS has an agreement in place with Kaplan, Inc., the parent company of DBS, to act as Guarantor, such that on the occurrence of what is called a Trigger Event, the Guarantor will refund the amount of money most recently paid for the course you are taking. The money will be paid back to whoever paid it. A Trigger Event means: where DBS does not provide the Programme for any reason including by reason of insolvency or winding-up of DBS, andor where Enrolled Learners have begun a Programme but not completed that Programme and DBS ceases to provide the said Programme before it is completed for any reason, including by reason of insolvency or winding up of DBS, andor where Quality Qualifications Ireland, the Higher Education regulatory body in Ireland, withdraws validation of a Programme under section 36(7), section 47, or section 59(7) of the 2012 Act. Money Most Recently Paid The money most recently paid to DBS by, or on behalf of, an Enrolled Learner in respect of a Programme for tuition fees registration fees examination fees library feesstudent services fees, and any other fees which relate to the provision of education, training and related services. Payer is the person who paid the Money Most Recently Paid. In the event that the Programme(s) cease prior to completion, the General Counsel for Kaplan International will be responsible for initiating the drawing down of the guaranteed amounts and ensuring that they are distributed to learners or payers, in accordance with Section 65 (4) (b) of the Act.

An honours degree in Accounting Finance with Part III ACCA Professional qualification is a major step towards achieving that goal. It is a popular choice with students who want to move directly into a career in accountancy as well as those who recognise the value of an accounting degree in a wider business management context. The BA in Accounting Finance (Hons) with Part III ACCA Professional qualification programme provides comprehensive education in the quantitative, computational and analytical skills required in the business world. Students learn about the role and operation of accounting in a range of contexts, informed by current thinking and research in the discipline.

Along with all thats happening in the city centre, the DBS Student Services department organises exclusive nights throughout the year for the students of the College. Freshers Week Freshers Week at DBS took place in the first week of October, and our new batch of students were treated to a variety of activities throughout the week to ensure they settled in, got to know each other, and most importantly had fun! At DBS our Student Experience Team are dedicated to making sure each college year is bigger and better than the last, and this year was no exception. Read more about the events that took place in Freshers Week 2018. Halloween Ball At this time of year the Students have settled into their studies and are ready to get dressed up and dance the night away at the Halloween Ball. This year Students pulled out all the stops to dress up and the atmosphere in the cobweb filled NV nightclub was second to none! Graduation Reception After the Graduation ceremonies we invite all graduates to join us for a drinks reception to say goodbye to DBS and mingle with their fellow graduates. The reception this year took place in Kobra bar Bia Bar on the 12th 13th of November. Everybody was in high spirits seeing their classmates again and sharing their new experiences outside DBS. Wacky Tacky Comedy Show Organised by our very own event management Students, the Wacky Tacky comedy show was a barrel of laughs, and all for a good cause too, the Laura Lynn Foundation. The Event Took Place in the Laughter Lounge on 19th November. Tickets sold out and the Students raised over 4,000 for the charity which Im sure was greatly appreciated by the children who benefited from it. Well done everybody! Christmas Ball The Christmas Ball is one of the last chances for students to mingle with each other before the Christmas holidays! The Christmas Ball is generally one of the largest attended events in the year, where some students dress up as elves, Santas helpers, and of course the main man, Santa Claus! This years Christmas Ball was held in the Alexander OCallaghan Hotel, Fenian Street, Dublin 2. Chinese New Year Also known as the lunar New Year, This year our Chinese Students will celebrate the year of the Monkey. A day of entertainment in Castle House was organised by the DBS Chinese Society who did a great job sharing their culture and traditions! The Annual Ball Possibly the most important event of the year, The Annual Formal Ball gives Students and Staff the chance to put on their finest formal attire and enjoy a four course meal, live entertainment, and Dj until the early hours of the morning. Tickets are highly sought after and those who get them are rarely disappointed! Last year the Ball was held in the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Santry, where Students were treated to a delicious 4 course meal only to dance the night away afterwards! RAG Week As it gets later in the year all eyes are on the coming summer exams, however RAG week is just early enough for the Students to have one last week of fun before they get stuck into the books! Similar to Freshers week RAG week is another week of events for students to enjoy before the end of year exams and summer holidays. Last year saw some wild events such as the Gumball Rally (where Students race to complete wacky tasks around Dublin city), followed by pub games and live DJ. The week was finished off with a Mardi Gras themed RAG Ball, which was organised this year by the 2nd Year Marketing Event Management Students!

The BA (Hons) in Sustainability Management programme aims to provide learners with the knowledge, skills, and mindset necessary to address global sustainability challenges, as well as creating and maintaining sustainable operations in the public, commercial and not-for-profit sectors. Moreover, the decision to align the curriculum of this proposed BA (Hons) in Sustainability Management programme with the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is rooted in the recognition of the urgent need to address global sustainability challenges. By integrating the SDGs into our curriculum, we aim to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the interconnected nature of sustainability issues and empower them to contribute meaningfully to achieving the SDGs. (See Section 2.9 Table 2.9 Programme Module Alignment to SDGs). This interdisciplinary approach allows students to explore the social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainability and develop the knowledge, skills, and mindset required to tackle complex problems. By aligning with the SDGs, we ensure that our graduates are equipped with the necessary tools to make a positive impact in areas such as poverty eradication, climate action, sustainable cities, responsible consumption, and many more. We believe that by integrating the SDGs into our curriculum, we can foster a generation of sustainability professionals who are capable of driving transformative change and shaping a more sustainable and equitable future. The Sustainability Management programme objectives are to: Equip learners with an understanding of the theory and principles underlying sustainability development and sustainability management in a business context. Advance in learners an appropriate expertise in the major aspects of sustainability, and an awareness of core disciplines. Develop a range of key interpersonal skills, characteristics, and attitudes to learners to work professionally, individually and in a team. Cultivate in learners a range of key skills, personal qualities, and attitudes essential to support progression to a career in business or to further academic study. Develop a learners capacity to organise diverse information, arguments, and conclusions and present them in a clear coherent way. Relate sustainability principles, concepts theories and frameworks to a wide range of business and industry settings. Understand the various functions of sustainability management and demonstrate this awareness by producing a multi-faceted and innovative business strategy. Enable learners to apply their learning in their professional lives reflecting their professional and personal development.

Awarding Body and NFQ Level This programme has been validated and approved by the Irish state agency, QQI (Quality and Qualifications Ireland). The programme is positioned at Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), a framework for the development, recognition and award of qualifications in Ireland. The programme is listed on the Irish Register of Qualifications. Under QQI, DBS is obliged to carry out reviews and re-submit the programme for re-approval on a cyclical basis. This means that, during your programme of study, there may be changes to programme content or delivery. Where this occurs, transition arrangements are carefully considered to ensure coherence and consistency for learners. Sustainability Course Structure Stage one lays the groundwork for the programme. This stage encompasses foundational modules such as Business Context and Organisation, Marketing Essentials, Economics and the World of Business, Sustainability 101, SDGs Literacy, and Applied Sustainability Project 1. In this way, this year focuses on providing a solid and comprehensive understanding of the relevant sustainability in a business context. Stage two builds on this by covering Management, Project Feasibility, Business Ethics and Research Practice, Digital Business Solutions, Sustainable Marketing Practices, Sustainable Business, International Economics, Sustainability Regulation and Compliance, and Applied Sustainability Project 2. Structured in this way, the understanding and skills acquired in the first year can be utilised and which later years can build. The modules, when taken together, provide key skills for enabling the execution of strategic changes based on insights from interdisciplinary outputs such as management or IS to ensure agility within the market. As such, this programme has been designed as a BA (Hons) in Sustainability Management that includes added interdisciplinary modules. The award stage covers a range of specialised topical areas such as Green Finance, Strategic Management, Human Resource Management, Leadership in Sustainable Enterprises, Supply Chain Sustainability, Environmental Protection and Eco-social policies, Business Society, and Applied Sustainability Project 3. These modules provide learners with a wider choice of educational opportunities in alignment with the ethos of the extant programme. The Applied Sustainability Project modules in all three stages capture the learning acquired in each stage as well as previous learning and experience. To synthesise learning into a strategic report is a key graduate attribute and ensures the diversity of modules on the programme are linked and interrelated as they would be in a contemporary business organisation within an awareness of sustainable development. Career Opportunities in Sustainability Management The sustainability-related job market in Ireland and across Europe has witnessed significant growth and diversification in recent years. As the EU increasingly prioritises sustainability and moves forward to mitigate climate change, the demand for professionals in sustainability-related fields has surged across various sectors, such as renewable energy, sustainable transport, sustainable agriculture, waste management, circular economy, sustainable finance, corporate sustainability, ESG analysis, and sustainable urban planning, among others.

It is the study of human behaviour in all its forms normal and abnormal, natural and learned, productive and destructive. It is a modern and progressive area of study, which with a 150-year history, is currently experiencing unprecedented growth and development in Ireland and internationally. Professional psychologists work in almost every sphere of contemporary life. Psychology contributes to the design of our classrooms and what takes place in them. Psychology teaches employers the best ways to select and motivate employees. Psychology provides crucial insight into the background of social problems such as suicide, addiction and child abuse. They help coaches to train athletes, help the police to investigate crime, help managers to reduce stress in the workplace and help the health services to design effective health promotion campaigns (for example, anti-smoking and safe driving campaigns). Aims Objectives The general programme aims are as follows: To provide learners with the opportunity to develop, deepen and expand their theoretical knowledge of Psychology. To equip learners with the knowledge, skills and competence required to progress in specialist and applied areas of Psychology. To facilitate in learners a critical knowledge of the main domains of the empirical study of Psychology. To develop in learners a critical awareness of the contribution of Psychology to understanding human behaviour and experience. To allow learners to engage in advanced theoretical debates relevant to the understanding of contemporary issues in society. To give learners an opportunity to access specific and sufficient areas of study to permit them to access relevant further professional recognition. PSI Accredited The BA (Hons) in Psychology is accredited by the Psychological Society of Ireland, the professional body for psychology in Ireland. As such, it seeks to promote the science and profession of psychology in Ireland and beyond. PSI membership now stands at over 2000 members, and includes practitioners, educators and researchers, professionals and postgraduate students, as well as undergraduate degree holders. In order to be eligible for PSI Graduate Membership, students must pass the independent research psychology project, and gain at least a Lower Second Class Honours degree, or its equivalent (i.e. an overall pass mark of at least 50 per cent for conversion programmes). Delivery This programme is taught on a hybrid basis. This means learners are timetabled either in-class or online, in a mix of online and in-class days. Student Testimonial I chose DBS as the programme was offered part time which best suited my circumstances as a single parent, it allowed me to work around my children. I always had an interest in Psychology and I really enjoyed the in-depth study of human behaviour delivered by excellent lecturers. I feel much more confident in gaining employment in my chosen field and the knowledge I gained during my time in DBS is invaluable.

A professional hacker uses different tools and platforms to penetrate the security that has been implemented to check for weaknesses. Therefore, to understand how hackers enter secure systems, retrieve confidential information or plant malicious software inside computers and networks, then you need to experience hacking first-hand. The Ethical Hacking course takes a deep dive into the main areas of hacking: Web Hacking, Network Hacking and exploiting coding vulnerabilities in software. By using isolated virtual environments like Kali Linux, this hacking can be practiced in a safe environment. In addition, this course also looks at various stages of penetration testing: Planning and Reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining, Access, Maintaining Access and Analysis. Programme Aims and Objectives Aims This programme aims to immerse learners into the area of ethical hacking with a view to enabling them to understand how to identify and exploit computer systems in order to check for weaknesses and expose threats in an organisations computer system. Objectives Provide learners with a deep understanding on how to analyse a website, examine it for vulnerabilities and exploit those vulnerabilities. Introduce learners to the area of penetration testing. Equip learner with the knowhow of setting up a virtual environment in which to perform attacks in a safe and isolated manner. Understand how unsecure software can be exploited, looking at some of the common vulnerabilities including buffer overflow, heap overflow and stack overflow. Assessment To meet the requirements of the Diploma in Ethical Hacking students will have to complete continuous assessment in the form of an individual written assignment and a presentation. Students will work on a project to identify vulnerabilities and then present the results to the class. Please note this programme is not on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). Course Content The lecturing team consists of a team of staff that combine both academic qualifications with substantial practical experience, and this practical perspective is reflected in the delivery of the course. The diploma is broken into 3 areas: web hacking, network hacking, and exploiting coding vulnerabilities in software. Some of the key subject areas are the following: Web Hacking Introduction and overview of Ethical Hacking Introduction to Linux Python Penetration Testing: Planning and Reconnaissance, Scanning, Access and Analysis Coding Vulnerabilities Structure The key subject areas are delivered over 12 weeks with project assignment. Each week will consist of a number of different activities which incorporate classroom, live discussion forums and Moodle resources.

The World Economic Forum lists cyber-attacks as 5th in the top 10 global risks and this can affect an individuals business or work in a number of ways. Cybersecurity is therefore used by individuals and businesses to protect against unauthorised access to data centres and computerised systems. DBS cybersecurity courses are part of a new suite of professional diplomas and courses that provide students the opportunity to upskill and enhance skills for the work environment. Our Professional Diploma in Cybersecurity looks at the four main areas of security: Web, Systems, Communications and Software: Secure Web; Secure Systems; Secure Communications; Secure Software. Learners will understand the fundamentals of cybersecurity with hands-on practical experience of key areas. This programme is specifically designed to give learners the knowledge and skills to implement changes that have tangible benefit to their respective companies and also give them the confidence required to communicate the importance of cybersecurity within an organisation to non-technical people. This cybersecurity programme has been designed for learners with non-cognate backgrounds and no technical knowledge or those with cognate background but lacking technical skills and knowledge. DBS is an active member of the national cybersecurity cluster, Cyber Ireland, which has over 130 members invested into the cybersecurity ecosystem, including UCD, McAfee, Accenture, IBM, Hewlett Packard and Ergo. As a member, the College has been provided with regular access to a number of events, research materials and industry liaisons informing the College in the development of this programme as well as cybersecurity modules on existing taught programmes. If you want to further your education even more in the cybersecurity field, DBS offer a Master of Science in Cybersecurity . Programme Aims and Objectives Aims of Cybersecurity Course This programme aims to immerse learners into the area of Cybersecurity with a view to enabling them to be able to act on the real threats that face companies in todays business environment. Objectives Provide learners with an understanding of the threats posed to websites including session hijacking, secure authentication and SQL injection attacks. Equip learners to do full penetration testing on their systems. Introduce learners to the area of cryptography by using public-key (asymmetric) encryption to do secure communication. Understand the risks posed by unsecure software, looking at some of the threats posed by common vulnerabilities including buffer overflow, heap overflow and stack overflow. Assessment To successfully complete the programme the learners will be assessed through 3 separate individual assessments. These practical assessments will enable the students to apply the topics covered as part of the programme. Please note this programme is not on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). Course Content The lecturing team consists of a team of staff that combine both academic qualifications with substantial practical experience, and this practical perspective is reflected in the delivery of the course. The diploma is broken into 4 areas: secure web, secure communications, secure systems and secure software. Some of the key subject areas are the following: Secure Web Websites are a vital part of business in todays world. They are also a major threat factor when securing your business. As part of this topic, we will look at the various threats that exist including session hijacking, secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), HTTPS over HTTP and SQL Injection attacks. Secure Systems A companys website and email server are not the only entry point to their systems. It is not uncommon for companies to leave open ports, either intentionally when using third party services or unintentionally when installing or configuring new software. Penetration Testing is the practice of testing a computer system, network or web application to find security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. Here will examine all of steps involved in the process: Planning and reconnaissance, Scanning, Gaining, Access, Maintaining access and Analysis. In addition, we will simulate how MAC Flooding with ARP Spoofing attack works and how to protect against it. Secure Communications A company email format is rarely secret. Their domain addresses are normally listed on their website. This leads various attempts to access systems using email phishing techniques. We will look at how email phishing works and how to protect against it. This section will also look asymmetric (public-key) cryptography and how it can be used in secure communications. Secure Software Many businesses today rely on custom built software that will be installed internally on their systems. Using third party software to scan for potential threats is one part of the process, but here we dig a little deeper to look at some common software vulnerabilities including: buffer overflow, heap overflow and stack overflow. Structure The key subject areas are delivered over 12 weeks with project assignment.

Reasons to Study a Postgraduate Course with DBS In todays competitive job market, a postgraduate qualification can help differentiate you as a candidate to prospective employers. Not only will it look great on your CV, the skills, expertise, knowledge, and networking opportunities you will gain from studying a masters degree will stand to you for the duration of your career. Dublin Business School specialises in the provision of contemporary postgraduate courses in the areas of Arts, Business, and the Humanities. Recent additions to our programme range include the MSc in FinTech , the MSc in Digital Marketing and the MSc in Data Analytics . We have many other postgraduate programmes on offer, including the Master of Business Administration which has a number of streams to choose such as Finance, HRM, Marketing and Project Management. If you are a recent college graduate, or further into your professional career, now is the time to start thinking about your further education options. Here are some of the reasons why you should study a postgraduate course. Increase your Knowledge An undergraduate degree provides students with a solid foundation of knowledge on their chosen subject. A postgraduate degree will endeavour to deepen this knowledge, and students are given the opportunity to complete a dissertation and become a specialist in their field. This is a crucial element of all postgraduate programmes, and the body of work produced will showcase your ability to research and write effectively, critically analyse literature, and produce high quality work with discipline and consistency. Widen your Skillset This brings us on to the next big advantage of a postgraduate qualification, learning new skills. Not only will you gain hard skills, which depending on your course of choice could include topics such as Financial Analysis, Clinical Practice, Digital Advertising and Online Marketing, Applied Neuroscience or Software Engineering, you will also learn a number of useful soft skills, which are invaluable to employers. Some of these soft skills include communication, working under pressure, project management, self-motivation, and time management. Soft skills are becoming ever-more desirable in the workplace as employers recognise their importance, and these skills can give you an edge over a candidate with stronger technical ability. Deloitte reported that by 2030, soft skill intensive occupations will account for two-thirds of all jobs. Better Job Opportunities You may have your eye on a particular company, or a number of companies that you would be interested in working for, and a degree from a postgraduate course will help you on your way to securing your dream position. The biggest and best-known firms receive hundreds of applications for each job post, so you want to give yourself the best chance in standing out to them and not waste fruitless hours filling out application forms only to be rejected. The jobs market is booming and Ireland is home to some of the worlds biggest tech giants and industry leaders including Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Accenture, Apple, Microsoft, Indeed, HubSpot, Twitter, and many more. There is ample opportunity for top graduates who have the drive and desire to succeed. Higher Salary Its no secret that the more qualified you are, the higher the salary you can command. A postgraduate degree should be seen as an investment with a lifelong return. According to The Irish Times , the HEA found a clear premium for postgrads, with 43 per cent of taught postgrads earning between 35,000-79,999 compared to just 24 per cent who have an undergraduate degree alone. Heres what some of our graduates had to say about their postgraduate study experience at DBS. I definitely improved my existing skills, particularly in time management, strategy, corporate governance, and financial analysis. I have also successfully implemented ideas I have taken from the course into our organisation, and they have absolutely contributed to the continued success of the business. Alan Hogan, MBA I feel the MSc has equipped me with practical skills and knowledge, which will be valuable in terms of my career moving forward. Since completing the course, I have begun to look at some employment prospects and apply for positions that I previously may have been unaware of or felt underqualified for. Having completed the course I feel confident that I will soon secure an exciting position within the library sector. Daire ODriscoll, MSc in Information and Library Management . Having studied in the area of psychoanalysis previously I was eager to enter in to work in which the clinical component was emphasised and this Masters provided that.

The integration of finance and technology has resulted in one of the most rapid and profound shifts in skills requirements within an industry in recent times. This rapid change required current and future employees in financial services to develop a capacity in the areas of finance, technology, regulation and data science to be able to effectively operate in the industry. Moreover, employers continue to value employees that have developed advanced critical thinking, writing and research skills, and throughout the programme, learners have many opportunities to develop these important skills so that they emerge from the programme job-ready. The taught component of this programme comprises core modules in Quantitative Financial Modelling, FinTech Regulation, Information and Cybersecurity Management, Distributed Ledger and Asset Tokenisation, Data Analytics and Machine Learning, Applied Financial Analysis and Research Methods one and two. To graduate with an MSc in Financial Technology the learner must complete 9 required modules (varying between 4 and 10 ECTS) and choose one of the capstone options, namely the Applied Research Project, the Dissertation or the Placement, each of which is 30 ECTS. Aims Objectives The specific programme objectives are as follows: - To enable learners to develop mastery of current and developing financial technologies. - To provide learners with a deep and systematic knowledge of the management of Financial Technology in organisational and regulatory contexts. - To facilitate the development by the learner of applied skills that are directly complementary and relevant to the workplace. - To identify and develop autonomous learning skills for the learner. - To develop in the learner a deep and systematic understanding of current issues of research and analysis. - To enable the learner to identify, develop and apply detailed analytical, creative, problem solving and research skills. - Provide the learner with a comprehensive platform for career development, innovation and further study.

The following milestones in its development have been of immense significance in this recognition. Recognised as a Designated Institution under the NCEA Act in 1992 Became an institution with accredited provision status of Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) in 1995 Recognised as an Associate College of Henley in 1996 Courses approved for tax purposes by the Department of Education in 1997 Approved for inclusion on the CAO listing in 1998 QQI the National Framework of Qualifications DBS Degree, Postgraduate Higher Diploma and Masters programmes are accredited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). QQI was established on 6 November 2012 under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012. The new Authority was created by an amalgamation of four bodies that have both awarding and quality assurance responsibilities: the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC), the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) and the Irish Universities Quality Board (IUQB). The new Authority has assumed all the functions of the four legacy bodies while also having responsibility for new or newly-statutory responsibilities in particular areas. Ten Level System The National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) is a ten-level system (110) giving an academic or vocational value to qualifications obtained in Ireland. NFQ levels help indicate how an award can be used for training, education and employment opportunities (see fan diagram). Each level is based on nationally agreed standards of what a learner is expected to know and be able to do after receiving an award. QQI is Irelands guardian of the NFQ system. They are responsible for the quality assurance of providers of education and training. They also have responsibility for the validation of qualifications and also make some awards themselves. NFQ serves several purposes: - It ensures awards obtained in Ireland are quality-assured and recognised internationally - It is part of a system for comparing Irish and international awards - It supports lifelong learning by recognising knowledge and skills within a comparative framework even if they are not recognised by a formal award - It provides a system of establishing eligibility in learning processes for access, transfer and progression - It recognises awards made by professional bodies International NFQ is linked to similar frameworks in Europe. This helps people considering employment or study opportunities outside Ireland. There are two qualifications frameworks at European level: 1. The Framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area also known as the Bologna Framework. This deals with higher education awards (NFQ 6-10). 2. The European Qualifications Framework (EQF), which deals with all NFQ levels including schools, Further Education and Training, and Higher Education. For students who are contemplating a career in Secondary School teaching, we were the first independent college whose degrees were fully recognised by the Department of Education for admission onto the Higher Diploma in Education programmes, offered in various universities throughout the country. Many of our graduates have been accepted onto postgraduate and masters programmes offered by the main universities in Ireland and abroad. www.education.ie . All of our degrees are recognised for exemption purposes by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA). Our BA (Hons) Accounting and Finance degree programme receives the maximum number of exemptions available from the professional accounting bodies. The School has established an excellent reputation for success in professional examinations, particularly the professional accounting examinations. Success has been based on a commitment to excellence in all aspects of teaching and student support and on the dedication of our highly qualified staff. Success is evident in our consistent record of exceptionally high pass rates, far in excess of international norms, and outstanding individual performances, including prizes for 1st Place in the world on several occasions. ACCA website www.accaglobal.com The Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) is a UK based professional body offering training and qualification in management accountancy and related subjects. It is focused on accountants working in industry, and provides ongoing support and training for members. As a trusted partner of CIMA, we are the only official publisher of CIMA study materials. DBS, as part of Kaplan, is the only official CIMA publisher worldwide and all DBS CIMA materials are reviewed and approved by the CIMA faculty. DBS, as part of Kaplan Inc., also has pass rates of up to 94 on CIMA tests. We also offer flexible study options CIMA Live Online and CIMA OnDemand . The BA (Hons) Counselling Psychotherapy degree at Dublin Business School is recognised by the Irish Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy. The Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (IACP) has been established since 1981 in response to the perceived need by practitioners to have a National Association to set standards and criteria for the practice of counselling and psychotherapy. The IACP represents the interests of both client and counsellor in Ireland. Accreditation by the IACP helps to ensure that practitioners are appropriately qualified and work to recognised standards of professional competence. At present IACP membership exceeds 2,500. www.irish-counselling.ie . The MA in Psychotherapy offers a postgraduate qualification which meets requirements for professional training for individuals interested in training as humanistic and psychodynamic psychotherapists in the integrative model. For instance, the Masters in Psychotherapy combined with our Higher Diploma in Counselling and Psychotherapy is recognised as a 4 year training by IAHIP (Irish Association for Humanistic Integrative Psychotherapy). DBS was the first college outside the University sector to receive accreditation from the Psychological Society of Ireland for its BA (Hons) Psychology degree. The Psychological Society of Ireland (PSI) is the professional body for psychology in Ireland. As such, it seeks to promote the science and profession of psychology in Ireland and beyond. PSI membership now stands at over 2000 members and includes practitioners, educators and researchers, professionals and postgraduate students, as well as undergraduate subscribers. Its Divisions and Special Interest Groups represent key areas from across the broad spectrum of psychology. The PSI liaises with all third-level institutions offering psychological training in Ireland, developing and setting criteria against which training can be evaluated, and operating systems for the accreditation of professional training programmes. For those working in psychology, it provides professional registration for practitioners in all areas. Visit http:www.psychologicalsociety.ie for more information. The MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy meets the Professional Bodys Masters component requirement which, when combined with the Post-Masters component, makes graduates eligible to apply with confidence for accredited membership of this Body. For instance, the MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, combined with the Post-Masters Specific Modality Training in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in The School of Psychotherapy (TSOP) at St Vincents University, is recognised as a (minimum) 4-year training by the Association for Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy in Ireland (APPI). Graduates of the combined programme, Masters Post-Masters, are eligible to apply for membership of APPI which then automatically means membership of the Irish Council for Psychotherapy (ICP). In turn, these graduates meet requirements to apply for membership of the European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP). The MSc in Information and Library Management at Dublin Business School is accredited by the Library Association of Ireland (LAI). The Library Association of Ireland was founded in 1928 as the professional body representing libraries and librarianship in Ireland. The objectives of the LAI include the promotion and development of high standards of librarianship and of library and information services in Ireland and to maintain the profession of librarianship in a proper status among the learned and technical professions by requiring the observance of strict rules of personal professional conduct as a condition of membership, and by ensuring that a qualification in librarianship is an essential requirement for all professional posts in libraries. The LAI also promotes a high standard of education for librarianship in Ireland by evaluating and giving recognition to degrees, diplomas or other professional qualifications in librarianship, thereby ensuring that graduates of the MSc in Information and Library Management meet the standards required within the information and library sector in Ireland. More information can be found on the LAI website: https:libraryassociation.ie DBS has been reviewed and approved as a provider of Project Management by the Project Management Institute (PMI) . As a PMI Approved Training Provider (ATP), DBS has agreed to abide by PMI-established quality assurance criteria. DBS has been approved by PMI to issue contact hours and PDUs for this course. Our trainers are PMP credential holders. DBS instructors with the ATP Instructor seal are authorised to teach PMP exam prep. The PMI Authorised Training Partner seal is a mark of the Project Management Institute, Inc. DBS is a member of the AACSB Business Education Alliance . Membership in AACSB, and participation in the Business Education Alliance, does not imply accreditation.

It features a blend of specialised accounting and finance subjects together with general business subjects. It aims to develop an awareness of the international relationships between finance and other business disciplines, to develop a critical and methodical approach to problem solving and decision making in a financial context and to develop the ability to interpret and communicate financial and other information. Ireland has an exceptionally strong international financial services sector with particular strengths in administration and management of funds; reinsurance; cross border insurance and specialist finance, such as aviation leasing and asset finance. As a result, there is a continuing need for well-educated staff to work as managers, accountants, auditors, financial accounting, management accountants, professional advisers, regulators and service providers with sophisticated domain knowledge in the key business provision of financial services. Ireland is a very profitable location for multinationals and financial service providers, due to the combination of high productivity and a cost base that is very competitive with other locations, which have similarly sophisticated ecosystems. The IFS 2020 identifies a need for further education in this area to fill the skills gap, which arises in start-up, indigenous and multinational companies. This programme accommodates a wide audience of learners whose specific interests in Accounting Finance. This programme is a 3-year Full Time programme and a 4-year Part-Time programme.

The programme may be of interest for both full time and part time learners that already work in the profession and are seeking career progression through attaining a degree qualification, or who are seeking to enter into the profession. ACCA CIMA The programme is aligned to the ACCA syllabus and graduates are currently exempted from all 9 of the Fundamental level ACCA exams and 7 CIMA paper exemptions. In order to maintain exemptions, delivery and assessment of the programme may be subject to additional requirements which do not apply to other programmes or to modules which are cross listed with other programmes (including sitting Closed Book examinations). Objectives The programmes specific objectives are to: To provide learners with knowledge and understanding of the fundamental theories, concepts and methods of accounting and finance and the interrelationship between the accounting and finance functions and complementary business disciplines. To provide and develop a professional competency in the techniques and models necessary to prepare financial information for internal and external stakeholders and to interpret the significance and relevance of that information.

To equip learners with the ability to communicate financial information in an effective and coherent manner using both written and oral media whilst giving due regard to technical standards, ethical business practices and sound corporate governance. To cultivate an appreciation of how current and emerging issues are likely to impact on the future development and direction of accounting and finance practices. To provide learners with the underpinning knowledge to pursue future postgraduate study. To provide a strong link with the major professional accounting bodies and afford learners the opportunity to maximise potential exemptions in further professional study. Facilitate the development by the learner of applied skills that are directly complementary and relevant to the workplace. To enable the learner to identify, develop and apply analytical, creative, problem solving and research skills. To provide the learner with a comprehensive platform for career development, innovation and further study. Delivery All learners are expected to attend in person in class.

Student Testimonial DBS is not just a college that will help you succeed, but also a community that can help you and nurture you as a better individual. Some of the lecturers I had really helped me a lot. They inspired me to pursue and never give up when I was on the verge of quitting. I believe a small institution like DBS can provide greater opportunities for interaction with lecturers.

Student Testimonial I chose DBS from the encouraging testimoniesreviews from previous students of DBS and recommendations across personal surveys. It was easy to get in contact with staff and lectures for assistance. From doing my masters, I feel very confident in my abilities to become a tenured analyst for a major consulting firm. I have made major connections on LinkedIn which has been very supportive to my career prospects. Due to COVID-19 my classes were mostly online, which actually helped me with the transition from working physically in the office to working from home with my job.

DBS offers fully-blended learning through a combination of the following modes: Face to Face Classroom Tuition Live Online (LOL) Tuition OnDemand Learning Blended Learning allows for the most appropriate mode of delivery to be applied to different parts of the syllabus. Blended Learning Programmes on average are split out to 40 Face to Face Classroom Tuition, 30 Live Online and 30 OnDemand Learning but this does vary. What is Face to Face Classroom Tuition? The lecturer and students attend class on-site on DBS campus. This mode appears on timetables. It involves guided learning at a specific location and time. What is Live Online (LOL) Tuition? The lecturer and students are online at the same time in a Zoom room or digital communication platform. These sessions are typically used for workshops and facilitated discussions on topics and where possible are recorded. This mode appears on timetables. It involves guided learning online at a specific time. What is OnDemand Learning? OnDemand Learning is where the lecturer has prepared content or activities that the student accesses online and works through at their own pace. This content is not on a students timetable. However, OnDemand content is often connected to Face to Face or Live Online sessions and should be completed in advance of those classes. Some live sessions are independent of OnDemand content but some will be dependent upon the student having been through the OnDemand content.

The Diploma is geared towards learners from non-legal backgrounds, together with individuals working in the legal field who have no prior formal legal education. The course will provide an introduction to the core aspects of Irish law and the legal system. It is intended to provide an understanding of Constitutional Law principles, Contract, Tort, Criminal and Company Law issues and the law as it relates to property in Ireland, as well as European Law and Equity. Learners will study the law from a practical perspective and classes will be based on theory combined with problem solving situations and real world examples. Programme Aims and Objectives Aims The Advanced Diploma in Legal Studies programme aims to provide learners with exposure to the core areas of law in order to work as a legal practitioner, with legal knowledge in a commercial environment, or to undertake further advanced legal studies. Learners will gain knowledge of the scope, content, and operation of the core areas of Irish law and of the legal institutions that enforce it. This programme provides learners with an appropriate base of relevant study in which to analyse legal problems, receive sound knowledge on theoretical legal frameworks and a comprehensive perspective of the legal system. They gain an appreciation of how the different sources of law interrelate and an appreciation of how the European legal system operates. Objectives The programme objectives are to allow learners to: Understand the operation of the legal system and the core concepts and principles that underpin it. Comprehend the role of law and regulation within society. Develop knowledge of the concepts, processes, rules and regulations that govern the core areas of law. Acquire the analytical skills necessary to apply legal rules to factual situations of limited complexity. Develop foundational legal knowledge and comprehension, as well as academic and practical skills to progress further in their studies. Assessment Each module will be assessed by way of a final written examination only, worth 100 of the overall grade. This examination will assess all of the learning outcomes, questions will comprise a mixture of theoryessay-based questions, as well as problem-based questions, which will assess the learners ability to apply relevant legal theory and draw a reasoned conclusion. Please note this programme is not on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). Student Testimonial I chose the Advanced Diploma in Legal Studies as I was brought into the legal dept in my office and I wanted to learn a bit more about subjects. The lecturers were so approachable, nothing was issue to ask or revise on and always available for feedback. The class environment builds the comradery and I did enjoy that. I loved Equity Law with Oliver. He really made it an entertaining class to attend. EU was a very difficult subject but I have to say Donagh really made it a subject we could absorb. The accomplishment of a daunting task like return to education in your 40s is just something that you cant put into words. Classmates and lecturers on the same level, no question to small or big, this is what school should always be and the confidence you gain from interaction like this is off the charts. I would recommend DBS, its a great environment with lots of support available. DBS helped my career; I got promoted and I now have direct reports.

Transfer of your personal data to other countries As we are an international business with employees, entities and service providers all over the world, we may need to transfer the personal data you provide to us to other countries which may be outside the European Economic Area (EEA). The data protection laws in such countries may not be as comprehensive and provide the same level of protection for your personal data as those within the EEA. In these circumstances, we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personal data is handled as described in this Privacy Notice. These steps will include appropriate contractual mechanisms. Please contact us using the contact details in this Privacy Notice if you would like more information. 9. The security of your personal data We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, service providers, business partners, agents and other third parties who have a legitimate need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions or as otherwise agreed and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so. 10. Our storage and retention of your personal data We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. Please contact us using the contact details in this Privacy Notice if you would like more information. It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your working relationship with us. In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. 11. Your rights as a data subject Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to: Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a data subject access request). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Request correction of the personal that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected. Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below). Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it. Request the transfer of your personal data to another party. If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal data, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact us using the contact details in this Privacy Notice. No fee usually required You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances. What we may need from you We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. Your right to withdraw consent In circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal data for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact us using the contact details in this Privacy Notice. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law. 12. Changes to this Privacy Notice We reserve the right to update this Privacy Notice at any time, and we will provide you with a new Privacy Notice when we make any substantial updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time about the processing of your personal information.

Student Testimonial I was looking for a postgrad in Dublin, that wasnt as specialized as a masters and I found a course in DBS. I didnt do business as my undergrad so I wanted to choose a post grad that gave me a taste of what the business world had to offer. I liked the small classes, it gave me the opportunity to get to know everyone. I felt that my lecturers were fantastic and they really encouraged me and gave me good feedback, which allowed me to excel in the course. Before I began the course, I felt quite lost, not knowing what I wanted to do, whereas now I have more of an idea in the direction I want to go with my career. Im hoping to either be working in a marketing firm or set up my own business. Having finished my course, I feel a lot more confident in myself. When I go to interviews, I feel like the employer can see I have the knowledge to back everything up that Im saying.

The purpose of SLATE2 is to outline a number of goals, objectives and actions to guide DBS to achieving its strategic objectives as they relate to teaching and learning, while best preparing DBS for the future of higher education. The Higher Diploma in Business has been designed with SLATE2 firmly at the forefront of thinking. The three overriding goals of SLATE2 are: 1. Outstanding Learning meaning a measurable engaging transformative learning experience that ensures our graduates are prepared for employment; 2. Immersive Learning meaning a learning environment that learners can immerse themselves in totally anytime and anywhere; and 3. An Ecosystem of Learning meaning An effective and complex interconnected network of people, processes and activities that recognises that all members of DBS at all times are empowered and impacting the learning experience. Each goal is accompanied by a number of objectives and a series of actions. The Higher Diploma in Business programme has taken these goals and ambitions into account whilst designing the programme. It recognises the centrality of preparing work-ready graduates whilst providing an environment for learning which tallies with the changes being undergone in the world of education and society generally, in terms of flexible delivery options allowing for multimodal learning and alternative routes of assessment The Higher Diploma in Business has been developed along the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which includes the value of offering authentic opportunities for assessment and assessing engagement as well as content. The updated modules have taken these considerations on board in producing a number of assessment modifications, with a stress being placed in a number of modules on the value of short defences and presentations to demonstrate an ability to coherently defend written pieces of assessment, whilst considering the incorporation of various tools to do so, whether they be posters, e-books or verbal presentationsdefences. Structure The Higher Diploma in Business is a one-year full-time (two academic semesters) or eighteen-month (three academic semesters) part-time programme with 12 taught modules (60 ECTS). All modules are mandatory and equal 5 ECTS. In full-time delivery, this is balanced between 6 modules in semester one and 6 modules in semester 2. Furthermore, the alignment means that students will have lectures over 3 days with 2 modules per day for continuity. In part-time delivery, this is balanced between 4 modules in semesters 1, 2 and 3. Semester one (FT) lays the groundwork for the programme and encompasses foundational modules on Business Operations Management, Business ICT, Legal Issues for Business, Business Sustainability, Economics in the Business Environment, and Management and Organisational Behaviour. Semester two (FT) gives the learner a more strategic and critical approach to business and business administration with modules on Human Capital Management, Global Marketing, Business Finance, Innovation, Creativity, and Enterprise, Supply Chain Management, and the Capstone module Business Strategy. Therefore, graduates will have the skills necessary to move into a management role within a variety of business functions such as marketing, people management or management of a department such as ICT within an organisation. They will have the business expertise to take a strategic view of business opportunities and challenges, and graduates will effectively integrate cutting-edge analytics into decision-making in their company. In this way, the Higher Diploma in Business offers a consolidated and emphasised focus on strategic business decision-making fully integrated with transferrable skills development as an effective means to improve business performance, productivity, and efficiency. Career Opportunities Learners who complete the Higher Diploma in Business will develop business acumen through formative and summative assessments, which capture the resilience and agility required of graduates in contemporary and diverse business environments. The need and relevance of agility for an organisation is bedded in each module delivery and assessment, and the learner will see how and why an organisation must function to ensure profitability, sustainability, relevance, and growth. The programme is rooted in creating a well-rounded business graduate whose insights will inform strategic business decisions, from financial to people management, designed to increase productivity, profitability and an organisations value and market share. The programme enables the learner to commence their career in business as well as underpinning further business postgraduate studies.

The BA (Hons) in Sustainability Management programme aims to provide learners with the knowledge, skills, and mindset necessary to address global sustainability challenges, as well as creating and maintaining sustainable operations in the public, commercial and not-for-profit sectors. Moreover, the decision to align the curriculum of this proposed BA (Hons) in Sustainability Management programme with the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is rooted in the recognition of the urgent need to address global sustainability challenges. By integrating the SDGs into our curriculum, we aim to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the interconnected nature of sustainability issues and empower them to contribute meaningfully to achieving the SDGs. (See Section 2.9 Table 2.9 Programme Module Alignment to SDGs). This interdisciplinary approach allows students to explore the social, environmental, and economic dimensions of sustainability and develop the knowledge, skills, and mindset required to tackle complex problems. By aligning with the SDGs, we ensure that our graduates are equipped with the necessary tools to make a positive impact in areas such as poverty eradication, climate action, sustainable cities, responsible consumption, and many more. We believe that by integrating the SDGs into our curriculum, we can foster a generation of sustainability professionals who are capable of driving transformative change and shaping a more sustainable and equitable future. The programmes specific objectives are to: Equip learners with an understanding of the theory and principles underlying sustainability development and sustainability management in a business context. Advance in learners an appropriate expertise in the major aspects of sustainability, and an awareness of core disciplines. Develop a range of key interpersonal skills, characteristics, and attitudes to learners to work professionally, individually and in a team. Cultivate in learners a range of key skills, personal qualities, and attitudes essential to support progression to a career in business or to further academic study. Develop a learners capacity to organise diverse information, arguments, and conclusions and present them in a clear coherent way. Relate sustainability principles, concepts theories and frameworks to a wide range of business and industry settings. Understand the various functions of sustainability management and demonstrate this awareness by producing a multi-faceted and innovative business strategy. Enable learners to apply their learning in their professional lives reflecting their professional and personal development.

Awarding Body and NFQ Level This programme has been validated and approved by the Irish state agency, QQI (Quality and Qualifications Ireland). The programme is positioned at Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), a framework for the development, recognition and award of qualifications in Ireland. The programme is listed on the Irish Register of Qualifications. Under QQI, DBS is obliged to carry out reviews and re-submit the programme for re-approval on a cyclical basis. This means that, during your programme of study, there may be changes to programme content or delivery. Where this occurs, transition arrangements are carefully considered to ensure coherence and consistency for learners. Part-time Sustainability Management Course Structure Stage one lays the groundwork for the programme. This stage encompasses foundational modules such as Business Context and Organisation, Marketing Essentials, Economics and the World of Business, Sustainability 101, SDGs Literacy, and Applied Sustainability Project 1. In this way, this year focuses on providing a solid and comprehensive understanding of the relevant sustainability in a business context. Stage two builds on this by covering Management, Project Feasibility, Business Ethics and Research Practice, Digital Business Solutions, Sustainable Marketing Practices, Sustainable Business, International Economics, Sustainability Regulation and Compliance, and Applied Sustainability Project 2. Structured in this way, the understanding and skills acquired in the first year can be utilised and which later years can build. The modules, when taken together, provide key skills for enabling the execution of strategic changes based on insights from interdisciplinary outputs such as management or IS to ensure agility within the market. As such, this programme has been designed as a BA (Hons) in Sustainability Management that includes added interdisciplinary modules. The award stage covers a range of specialised topical areas such as Green Finance, Strategic Management, Human Resource Management, Leadership in Sustainable Enterprises, Supply Chain Sustainability, Environmental Protection and Eco-social policies, Business Society, and Applied Sustainability Project 3. These modules provide learners with a wider choice of educational opportunities in alignment with the ethos of the extant programme. The Applied Sustainability Project modules in all three stages capture the learning acquired in each stage as well as previous learning and experience. To synthesise learning into a strategic report is a key graduate attribute and ensures the diversity of modules on the programme are linked and interrelated as they would be in a contemporary business organisation within an awareness of sustainable development. Career Opportunities in Sustainability Management The sustainability-related job market in Ireland and across Europe has witnessed significant growth and diversification in recent years. As the EU increasingly prioritises sustainability and moves forward to mitigate climate change, the demand for professionals in sustainability-related fields has surged across various sectors, such as renewable energy, sustainable transport, sustainable agriculture, waste management, circular economy, sustainable finance, corporate sustainability, ESG analysis, and sustainable urban planning, among others. Advanced roles in this evolving field will often require experience in the sector in addition to the qualification, but this programme lays the groundwork for roles such as: Environmental Sustainability Coordinator Student Sustainability Coordinator ESG Project Manager Environmental Educator Internal Sustainability Advisor Sustainability Engagement Coordinator These roles combine the traditional broad-based business skills with the focus on sustainability this programme is designed to offer.

The business content of this programme majors on general management, marketing and finance, while the IT content focuses on the practical application of IT to business situations and issues. Upon completion of the course graduates will have had a solid grounding in the skills and expertise needed to use information technology effectively, covering both the conceptual and technical aspects. Year 1 Seven mandatory subjects provide foundation knowledge in core business areas and disciplines including information technology. Year 2 Student knowledge in key business disciplines is developed and they are introduced to more specialised IT areas including Computer Systems Technologies and Fundamentals of Programming. Year 3 At the final year, the business focus moves to a more strategic level while advanced knowledge and skills are developed in specialist IT areas such as Database Designs, Cloud Technologies and Business Information Systems. Transfer Students Students holding a relevant higher certificate or other relevant qualifications may qualify for entry to the third year of the degree programme. Career Opportunities Modern organisations depend heavily on their information systems and often prefer to recruit graduates that have strong familiarity with and expertise in the IT area. Graduates from this programme will be very attractive to such organisations. They will be fully equipped to develop careers in general business management or in more specialised IT-related areas. They will be particularly well suited to positions (such as Business Analyst) that straddle the traditional divide between general management and IT management, or to which strong IT competency is a significant asset.

The course has been designed for graduates from a Level 8 Counselling and Psychotherapy programme who are suitable for supervised clinical training in humanistic and psychodynamic psychotherapy in accordance with the integrative model. A combination of the Higher Diploma in Arts in Counselling and Psychotherapy (or equivalent) and the MA in Psychotherapy at Dublin Business School should fulfil the requirements of a four-year training course that is expected by the professional bodies in the field of Psychotherapy. The MA course is also research focused and therefore provides students with a range of research skills appropriate to the field of counselling and psychotherapy. Key Features of the MA in Psychotherapy Designed for graduates from disciplines related to counselling and psychotherapy Aims to meet the needs of individuals who wish to train as professional Psychotherapists Designed with close attention paid to requirements of professional bodies and discussions regarding statutory and European regulation in the field Delivered on a modular basis, typically students will attend classes on two evenings per weeks attend weekend workshops once or twice a month Comprises of Theoretical components, Personal Psychotherapy, Weekly Process Groups Supervised Clinical CounsellingPsychotherapy Practice The orientation is primarily humanisticintegrative Includes master classes and workshops from experienced practitioners Delivery All learners are expected to attend in person in class. Entry Requirements The minimum entry requirements for the Master of Arts in Psychotherapy are: A Level 8 undergraduate honours degree with a minimum Second-Class Second Division (2.2) from a recognised third level institution in Counselling and Psychotherapy or an equivalent qualification in a cognate area from a recognised third level institution, or A graduate of any non-cognate discipline and hold a qualification in a conversion-style programme such as the DBS Higher Diploma in Arts in Counselling and Psychotherapy (wherein they have passed all requirements at honours level, including oral examination of professional suitability), or Hold an equivalent qualification in the field of Humanistic, Integrative and Psychodynamic study and training or have equivalent professional qualifications. Suitable candidates should be able to demonstrate significant life experience, self-awareness and maturity. Learners on the Master of Arts in Psychotherapy programme are required to have entered their own psychotherapy before commencement of the programme. This will have been a requirement of the required prior learning qualification indicated above. Prior learning qualifications should also have included a minimum of 60 hours process group work. Ideally candidates should also have experience either professionally or on a voluntary basis in a role which can be related to the work of counsellingpsychotherapy. Candidates are expected to be able to show evidence of having the personal qualities necessary to undertake psychotherapy training. To this end there is an interview process as part of the admissions procedure in order to assess academic and personal suitability. It is a requirement that all applicants are interviewed to assess professional suitability. Applicants who do not have a Level 8 qualification at a 2.2 award level and who have at least 3 years work experience may also be considered through the colleges normal RPL procedures. Relevant professional experience may be taken into account and individuals will be assessed on a case-by-case basis through DBS RPL procedures. Accreditation The MA in Psychotherapy offers a postgraduate qualification which meets requirements for professional training for individuals interested in training as humanistic and psychodynamic psychotherapists in the integrative model. For instance, the Masters in Psychotherapy combined with our Higher Diploma in Counselling and Psychotherapy is recognised as a 4 year training by IAHIP (Irish Association for Humanistic Integrative Psychotherapy). Garda Vetting The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012-2016 make it mandatory for people working unsupervised with children or vulnerable adults to be vetted by the Garda Siochana National Vetting Bureau. Under the Acts, anyone whose work or activity involves unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults must be vetted. Workers include staff, volunteers and those on student placements working for a relevant organisation where they have access to children andor vulnerable adults. DBS offers a number of educational Programmes that require students to undertake placements with external agencies, which will bring them into contact with the public and in which they will assume positions of trust. It is for this reason that students on these type of programmes are required to undergo vetting prior to commencing placements (or visits). New entrants on to these programmes will receive the relevant form and information in their orientation packs and will need to complete the process before their final registration on the course can be completed. At the time of application, students will be required to declare as to any previous convictions. Students can start on the course before their Garda clearance is completed but may be withdrawn if the vetting does not produce a satisfactory finding. Where a vetting process identifies a previous conviction the case will be referred to an internal College Vetting Committee. This committee will consider all relevant information in relation to a disclosure from the vetting process and make a determination on the case on behalf of the College. If a student has started on the course and is withdrawn because of a conviction that was not declared at the time of application, any fees paid will not be refunded. DBS will charge a fee of 25 to each student for the administration and costs of obtaining Garda clearance. This fee is payable at the commencement of the programme and is non refundable. Course Content The Master of Arts (MA) in Psychotherapy programme has the following content: Core Modules Supervised Clinical Practice Clinical Group Supervision Process Group Theory and Practice 1: Psychodynamic Psychotherapy Theory and Practice 2: Integrative Psychotherapy Theory and Practice 3: Object Relations Theory and Practice 4: Integrative Psychotherapy Gesalt Therapy Existential Psychotherapy Ethics and Contemporary Issues The Body in Psychotherapy Psychotherapy and the Public Sphere Workshops Self, Subject, Person Research Project Assessment Methods Each year students are assessed not only on their skills and academic knowledge but they also participate in two feedback meetings per year to discuss their progress in training. Feedback and assessment are the basis of a decision regarding their suitability for professional practice as counsellors and psychotherapists, and ultimately their qualification with the MA. Awarding Body and NFQ Level The programme is also currently recognised by the Irish Association for Humanistic and Integrative Psychotherapy (IAHIP) as part of an overall 4 year training programme in conjunction with the Higher Diploma in Arts in Counselling and Psychotherapy, to allow learners to meet the accreditation criteria in IAHIP Bye-law 11. As part of our ongoing obligation to quality assurance for QQI and IAHIP, DBS will carry out reviews and submit the programme for re-approval as required. This means that there may be changes to programme content or delivery during your programme of study. If this does occur, DBS will carefully consider all transition arrangements to ensure consistency for learners. CORU Recognition CORU is Irelands multi-profession health regulator whose role is to protect the public through regulating the health and social care professions listed in the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (as amended). It includes the Health and Social Care Professionals Council and the Registration Boards established under the Act 2005 (as amended). CORU confirmed the establishment of and appointment of members to the Counsellors and Psychotherapists Registration Board in 2019, under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 (amended) to separately regulate the professions of Counsellors and Psychotherapists. Currently there is no date for the opening of the CORU registers for Counsellors and Psychotherapists. Please refer to the CORU website for more information. DBS will make an application for programme approval to the Registration Board when CORU opens the process. Programme Specific Regulations Given the responsibility involved in the practice of psychotherapy it is essential that only learners assessed to be suitable for clinical practice are recommended to the Master of Arts in Psychotherapy to engage in supervised client practice regardless of their academic achievement. For this reason, the Higher Diploma in Counselling and Psychotherapy as a Level 8 award at the end of the first two years of the four-year professional training, which is recognised by IAHIP, is part of the assessment of suitability. Aside from this, there is also a further interview on application to the MA programme. This is fundamental to the design of the Masters in combination with the Higher Diploma as together they constitute four-year professional training recognised by IAHIP and in terms of maintaining standards for training and protecting learners and the public from inappropriate situations. Structure The MA in Psychotherapy is delivered on a modular basis during evenings and weekends and will normally take students two years to complete. During each year, students will normally study 2 evenings a week for two 12 week semesters and attend weekend experiential workshops and seminars. In this time students will participate in experiential group learning and attend academic lectures, both of which direct their study and understanding of counselling and the theories and practices of counselling and psychotherapy. In the second year of the programme there are two Master Class modules involving highly experienced practitioners bringing that experience to a teaching context. In order to best equip students research methodologies and the range of contemporary issues that face professional Psychotherapists will also be amongst the topics studied. Fundamental to training in the field of counselling and psychotherapy is the undergoing of ones own psychotherapy. This work of clarifying ones actions and motivations is challenging, stimulating and ultimately rewarding at a personal level as well as grounding professional practice. Students should expect to be in their own personal therapy for the duration of the MA. The MA programme involves students beginning supervised clinical counsellingpsychotherapy practice. Supporting this, in addition to the personal psychotherapy mentioned above are two forms of clinical supervision - individual and group. The two supervision arrangements provide the opportunity for students to articulate their questions regarding their therapeutic interventions and position. Group supervision is incorporated into the MA timetable. Payment in relation to ones personal psychotherapy and individual supervision is not included in the course fee and is arrange individually with the therapist and supervisor. All learners are expected to attend in person in class. Career Opportunities Holders of the MA in Psychotherapy will be qualified to work in the following areas: The Voluntary Sector Primary Care settings Social Care settings Educational settings Private Practice following admission to a professional body It is envisaged that the programme will appeal to those interested in further postgraduate study, such as at PhD level. Fees The course fees for the next academic year are 5,490 per annum. International Fees EU Fees You can also contact our admissions team who would be happy to discuss the options available for you.

It is the study of human behaviour in all its forms, normal and abnormal, nature and learned, productive and destructive. It is a modern and progressive area of study and, despite having a 150-year history, is currently experiencing unprecedented growth and development in Ireland and internationally. Programme Aims and Objectives The Diploma in Psychology allows learners to complete three core modules within the BA (Hons) in Psychology degree in DBS School of Arts and explore their own learning in a manner that allows them to exit, if they wish, after a year of study with a Diploma or continue as a part-time psychology learner (to progress to the degree programme students must meet minimum entry requirements for part-time students). Across the programme, three key areas are studied: Psychological Foundations, Foundations in Social Psychology, and Developmental Psychology. Psychology is clearly wide-ranging, and this is represented in the programme. Learners take modules in theoretical and applied aspects of psychology with the objective to inspire in learners an appreciation of the empirical methods of research into human behaviour. Assessment To meet the requirements of the Diploma in Psychology, learners will be required to complete continuous assessment for all three subjects and two end of year examinations. Continuous assessment will vary in style and purpose from module to module, depending upon the nature of the subject material and the teaching and learning objectives of the module. Assessments may include essays, multiple-choice questionnaire, short answer in-class examination, oral presentation, group work, and poster presentations. End of year examinations are typically held in late Aprilearly May for the September intake and in January for the Spring intake. Please note this programme is not on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ). DBSs Diploma in Psychology is a gateway to accredited psychology courses in Ireland, our degree masters courses are awarded by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI). See DBSs variety of psychology courses ranging from evening diplomas to postgraduate masters. Student Testimonial I chose DBS for its location, cost and timetable. The benefit of smaller institution is having smaller classes. It was easier to interact with other students and your lecturer. It can be intimidating going into larger classes you can get lost. I chose the Diploma in Psychology because I have an active interest in Psychology as it applies to everyone and every situation. I was keen to understand what drives peoples behaviour. The course exceeded my expectations. I learnt a vast amount in lots of different areas of psychology and it really opened up my mind to various theories psychological fields. It gave me a greater wider understanding of people dynamics. My lecturer was excellent and taught in a very informal and personal manner. His method of teaching encouraged me to attend class each week. Although there was a lot to take in in most classes, he made them enjoyable and gave us every chance to understand topics discussed. I created mind maps for some exams which really helped memorise. They are a wonderful tool to have going into an exam - advice given by my lecturer. I would recommend DBS for its good location, small classes and great lecturers. I became aware of different dynamics and how to handle some people and situations. Ive a good attitude and Im determined to do my job well, exceed expectations and not let anything overwhelm me. I feel content and I look Forward to what the future holds.

B - Part-time Overview Course Content Structure Career Opportunities Fees Next Steps Overview Course Content Structure Career Opportunities Fees Next Steps Overview The Bachelor of Laws (Hons) is recognised by the Honorable Society of Kings Inns and the Law Society of Ireland. Studying law at undergraduate level has an appeal to any student considering a career in the legal profession. A Bachelor of Laws degree provides a firm foundation for students wishing to qualify as a solicitor or barrister. The study of law improves and develops the students power of reasoning, clarity of thought and the ability to analyse and express complicated ideas. These skills also lend themselves to a wide variety of career options quite apart from private legal practice on completion of the programme. Aims and Objectives The objectives of the Bachelor of Laws (Hons) programme are: To provide learners with sound educational underpinning which will enable them to acquire a solid grounding in legal principles, the fundamental features of the Irish legal system and general transferable skills To equip learners with a fundamental understanding of the core Irish legal subjects to facilitate progression to the professional stage of training in Ireland with the Law Society of Ireland or the Kings Inns To enable learners to develop a range of transferable skills including the powers of inquiry, critical analysis and logical thinking, initiative, independent learning and commitment to scholarship To enable learners to develop a range of graduate skills in preparation for employment in a wide variety of fields and a fundamental understanding of society and of the role of law within society Professional Accreditation The Bachelor of Laws (Hons) enables graduates who wish to qualify as solicitors, to sit the Law Society of Ireland FE1 examinations, which are a prerequisite to training as a solicitor. The programme also enables graduates to sit the Honorable Society of Kings Inns entrance examinations the passing of which are a pre requisite for taking the Barrister-at-Law degree. Delivery Classes will be delivered through a blended mode, that is, some classes are hosted on-site in person, and others are live-online. The initial classes are hosted on campus, to help learners get settled, before moving online for most of the remainder of the year. On-site classes may be hosted, where required, at any point during the year, and final exams must be sat on site, in fulfilment of the Honourable Society of Kings Inns requirements, so learners will need to be able to attend on campus at any point during the semester. Entry Requirements The minimum entry requirements for this programme are: Leaving Certificate Applicants must obtain a minimum of 2H5s and 4 O6sH7s, to include English or another language, or FETACQQI A full Level 5 FETACQQI Award (i.e. 8 modules) with at least 3 distinctions, or A-Levels GCSE Applicants must obtain a minimum of 4 GCSE passes at grade C to include Mathematics and English or another language, plus 2 A-Level passes at grade C or higher, or BTEC Applicants must obtain a minimum of a BTEC National Diploma in a cognate area. For applicants whose first language is not English and who have not previously undertaken a degree taught through English, evidence must be provided of proficiency in English language equivalent to B2 or above on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL). This must be evidenced through a recognised English Language test such as IELTS, Cambridge Certificate, PTE or DBS English Assessment. Test certificates should be dated within the last two years to be considered valid. Mature All EU nationals aged 23 years before 1st of January in the year of application are classified as mature applicants. Mature learners can apply directly to the college and will be assessed on basis of age, work experience and educational attainment as outlined in the DBS Quality Assurance Handbook (QAH). Student Testimonial I chose DBS because they were able to offer a part time law degree in the evening. The lecturers were very approachable - full of knowledge and the online research tools that were made available were excellent. Since completing my course, I feel more positive about continuing forward in the legal world and having a good basis to complete FE1s.

The first-year modules are assessed by way of either 100 continuous assessment, or through an exam worth 60 and continuous assessment worth 40. In second year, the exam weighting will increase in four of the modules, but is balanced by the inclusion of continuous assessment in each module, while two modules remain 100 continuous assessment. In final year there is a higher emphasis on examination weighting in most modules. A capstone research essay (6-8,000 words) is part of the mandatory modules all learners will undertake. A blend of individual and group assessment has been factored into modules throughout the programme with a mix of the types of assessment in the modules. Final exams must be sat on site, in fulfilment of the Honourable Society of Kings Inns requirements. Awarding Body and NFQ Level This programme has been validated and approved by the Irish state agency, QQI (Quality and Qualifications Ireland). The programme is positioned at Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), a framework for the development, recognition, and award of qualifications in Ireland. The programme is listed on the Irish Register of Qualifications. The BA (Hons) in Law qualifications is approved by Kings Inns for the purposes of eligibility to sit the Entrance Examination to the degree of Barrister-at-Law professional course. In order to retain this eligibility, delivery and assessment of the programme may be subject to additional requirements which do not apply to other programmes or to modules which are cross listed with other programmes. Under QQI, DBS is obliged to carry out reviews and re-submit the programme for re-approval on a cyclical basis. This means that, during your programme of study, there may be changes to programme content or delivery. Where this occurs, transition arrangements are carefully considered to ensure coherence and consistency for learners. At all times, delivery of the programme must be in compliance with the approved programme and to achieve the recognised award learners must fulfil all assessment criteria. Structure The evening delivery of this programme undertakes a full-time-equivalent workload, to complete the programme across the same three years as full-time learners, but classes are hosted in the evenings instead, and learners undertake a greater proportion of independent learning. Students study four substantive law modules in first year in addition to a module focused on the acquisition of legal research skills, and a module designed to develop IT and digital skills. First year subjects are compulsory. In second year, students study six module, all modules are compulsory. In year three, there are three compulsory modules and students can select three other modules from a list of options. Electives will run subject to uptake in any given year. Classes will be delivered through a blended mode, that is, some classes are hosted on-site in person, and others are live-online. The initial classes are hosted on campus, to help learners get settled, before moving online for most of the remainder of the year. Career Opportunities The Bachelor of Laws degree provides a firm foundation for students wishing to train as solicitors or barristers. Additionally, a law degree is one of the most respected undergraduate qualifications. It opens up a range of career opportunities apart from the practice of the law. Law graduates are employed in a wide variety of areas including commercial industry, social sciences, politics, the media and the public service. A legal education therefore opens more doors than just the practice of law. Professional Accreditation The Bachelor of Laws (Hons) enables graduates who wish to qualify as solicitors, to sit the Law Society of Ireland entrance examinations. The Bachelor of Laws (Hons) also enables graduates to sit the Honorable Society of Kings Inns entrance examinations the passing of which are a pre requisite for taking the Barrister-at-Law degree.

Awarding Body and NFQ Level This programme has been validated and approved by the Irish state agency, QQI (Quality and Qualifications Ireland). The programme is positioned at Level 8 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ), a framework for the development, recognition, and award of qualifications in Ireland. The programme is listed on the Irish Register of Qualifications. The BA (Hons) in Law qualifications is approved by Kings Inns for the purposes of eligibility to sit the Entrance Examination to the degree of Barrister-at-Law professional course. In order to retain this eligibility, delivery and assessment of the programme may be subject to additional requirements which do not apply to other programmes or to modules which are cross listed with other programmes. Under QQI, DBS is obliged to carry out reviews and re-submit the programme for re-approval on a cyclical basis. This means that, during your programme of study, there may be changes to programme content or delivery. Where this occurs, transition arrangements are carefully considered to ensure coherence and consistency for learners. At all times, delivery of the programme must be in compliance with the approved programme and to achieve the recognised award learners must fulfil all assessment criteria. Structure Students study four substantive law modules in first year in addition to a module focused on the acquisition of legal research skills, and a module designed to develop IT and digital skills.

The initial classes are hosted on campus, to help learners get settled, before moving online for most of the remainder of the year. All learners are expected to attend in person in class. Career Opportunities The Bachelor of Laws degree provides a firm foundation for students wishing to train as solicitors or barristers. Additionally, a law degree is one of the most respected undergraduate qualifications. It opens up a range of career opportunities apart from the practice of the law. Law graduates are employed in a wide variety of areas including commercial industry, social sciences, politics, the media and the public service. A legal education therefore opens more doors than just the practice of law.
